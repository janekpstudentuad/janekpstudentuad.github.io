<h1 style="text-align: center;">CTF articles</h1>

This is a living notebook of security work in progress.

Here you’ll find write-ups from CTF challenges and labs (including Hack The Box, TryHackMe, and Hackviser, where permissable by the content provider), alongside notes from courses, conferences, and the occasional reflective post on security practice and career development. New content will be added gradually as challenges are completed and ideas take shape.

## About me
I currently work in defensive cyber security, with a strong personal interest in the offensive side of the discipline (I remain convinced my dream job is in penetration testing!). I hold an MSc in Ethical Hacking and Cyber Security, with a background rooted in IT, and enjoy exploring how attack techniques, tooling, and human factors intersect with real-world defence.

Outside of security, I spend time running, practising yoga, reading (particularly young adult fantasy and Stephen King), and being outnumbered by my dogs. If you'd like to find out a bit more about me, I also have a personal blog that you can find at [Unscripted and In Progress](https://unquietmindmusings.blogspot.com/)
