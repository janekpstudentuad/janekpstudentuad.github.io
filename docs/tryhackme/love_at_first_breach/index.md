# Love at First Breach (2026)

Love at First Breach was a Valentine's-themed CTF event that had two parts:  

1. A set of 10 offensive rooms of easy or medium difficulty, all focussed on web-based attacks of one sort or another. A "ticket" was awarded to users upon completion of each room, with more tickets equalling more entries in to the prize draw (spoiler alert, I didn't win anything!). Due to personal time constraints, I only managed to complete nine of the ten rooms within the time limit (detailed below).  
2. A competitive CTF event. Prizes were awarded to those users that finished the event in the quickest time. I didn't get to it before all the prizes were gone, but I did start to look at it before the end of the event.
