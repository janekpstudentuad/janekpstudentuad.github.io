# TryHackMe Rooms

**Love at First Breach (2026) Event**
Coined by THM as a "beginner friendly, live red-teaming CTF designed to help you fall in love with breaking things... safely", this was a ticketed event with prixes available for completing rooms within a certain time limit, accompanied with a competitive CTF with prizes awarded for first completion. My progress and related walkthroughs are detailed in a dedicated [Love at First Breach (2026)](./love_at_first_breach/index.md) page.
