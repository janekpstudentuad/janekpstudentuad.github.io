# Ethical Hacking and Cybersecurity MSc
I have undertaken an MSc in Ethical Hacking and Cyber Security, administered by Abertay University. It took me two years as I did it as part-time course (whilst also continuing to work full-time). Below is a brief outline of the modules that made up the course, along with the papers I submitted and their resulting grade. Further details of the course can be found on the [Abertay University website](https://www.abertay.ac.uk/course-search/postgraduate-taught/ethical-hacking-and-cybersecurity/).

I was awarded my MSc in November 2025, when I graduated **with distinction** and **a GPA of 4.33**.

## Year 1
### Trimester 1
#### CMP506 - Computer Security
The module explored issues relating to computer security and ethical hacking, including vulnerabilities and techniques for improving defences, UK computer security legislation, penetration test methodologies, and the report writing process. The assessment consisted of two parts:  
1. A 2500 word critical [essay](./cmp506_essay.pdf) on the subject of the Computer Misuse Act and how it pertains to a given case study scenario (25% of the overall mark). **Grade achieved:** A  
2. This part of the assessment consisted of practical work (a penetration test and malware analysis conducted on some provided test resources) with an accompanying [white paper](./cmp506_white_paper.pdf) documenting the findings from the practical work (75% of the overall mark). **Grade achieved:** A  

**Overall module grade achieved: A**

#### CMP508 - Information and Network Security Management
This module explored why information security matters and how it's reflected in policies like the UK government's "Keeping the UK Safe in Cyberspace" strategy. We also learned about threat modelling, risk, security auditing/testing and network management/security. The assessment consisted of two parts:  
1. A [portfolio](./cmp508_portfolio.md) (50% of the overall mark). **Grade achieved:** A  
2. A [report](./cmp508_voip_report.pdf) on VoIP network security practices, using a designed network as a reference (50% of the overall mark). **Grade achieved:** A

**Overall module grade achieved: A**

### Trimester 2
#### CMP509 - Ethical Hacking
This module gave insight into the techniques ethical hackers use to test the security of binary web applications. We learned how to plan and carry out investigations, understand how these techniques work, and explore the countermeasures used to defend against them. Malware analysis and Python scripting elements were integrated into the content for this module. The assessment consisted of two parts:  
1. Conduct a web application penetration test on a supplied environment and produce a [document](./cmp509_penetration_test.pdf) describing the findings and the methodology used (50% of the overall mark). **Grade achieved:** A+  
2. A scripting project - develop an automated tool (preferably in Python) to perform some form of offensive/defensive security task with accompanying [documentation](./cmp509_scripting_project.pdf) (50% of the overall mark). **Grade achieved:** A+  

**Overall module grade achieved: A+**

## Year 2
### Trimester 1
#### CMP507 - Digital Forensics
This module explored the technology and techniques used to investigate cybercrime. We learned how to plan and carry out a full computer forensic investigation, with a strong focus on collecting digital evidence and piecing together events. This module was fully assessed by coursework - conducting a forensic investigation of a supplied computer image and writing a [court report](./cmp507_court_report.pdf) detailing the findings. **Grade achieved:** A+  

### Trimester 2
#### CMP510 - Engineering Resilient Systems
This module explored how both human and technical hacking techniques are used to attack systems — and how understanding them helps build stronger defences. You’ll learn how to investigate methods of attack, apply countermeasures, and improve the overall resilience of systems by combining social and technical approaches by focussing on three main areas: software development, machine learning, and the human-factor. The assessment for this module consisting of three parts:  
1. *Software security* - produce a [report](./cmp510_software_security.pdf) detailing a recommendation for a fictional company on how to improve their security posture in relation to a specific software vulnerability (35% of the overall mark). **Grade achieved:** A  
2. *The human-factor* - produce a [report](./cmp510_human_factor.pdf) detailing a recommendation for a fictional company on how to improve their security posture in relation to its authentication design (25% of the overall mark). **Grade achieved:** A  
3. *Machine learning* - produce a classifier and accompanying [report](./cmp510_machine_learning.pdf) to automate the classification of network traffic on a supplied dataset (40% of the overall mark). **Grade achieved:** A+  

**Overall module grade achieved: A**  

#### GRS501 - Research Methods
This module introduces research methods and statistical analysis, combining theory with hands-on practice. We explored key approaches to research, how to apply both quantitative and qualitative techniques, statistical measures, and how to deal with ethics. Assessment for this module consisted of two components:  
1. A [portfolio](./grs501_portfolio.md) (50% of the overall mark). **Grade achieved:** A+  
2. A statistics exam (50% of the overall mark). **Grade achieved:** A+

**Overall module grade achieved: A+** 

### Trimester 3
#### CMP504 - Masters Project
Choose a topic and carry out a full research project:  

- Plan and experiment.  
- Build a working solution (the "artefact").  
- Collect and analyse data.  
- Evaluate and present findings.  

*Project title* - Evaluating Personalised Phishing Awareness Training: A Mixed Methods Study on Emotional Response, Engagement, and User Preference

**Grade achieved:** A+
